            As We May Think - Vannevar Bush, 1945
        </h1>
        <p>
            Dr. Vannevar Bush was a true intellectual pioneer for society. Whether it was his discussion through science, film, technology, or any subject at that matter, Bush was able to identify possible changes within human capabilities. I believe his main synopsis from As We May Think was that humans must thrive to expand their knowledge of science in order to reach the full potential that he envisioned. It is really interesting to note that Bush was very foreseeing throughout the entirety of the article. Although his words were spoken with much vagueness, Bush was able to envision many years ahead of his time for which technology would expand in the future. Personally, it was astonishing reading about all the topics covered and the level of vocabulary and intricacy he had considering the era the article was written in. 
            Bush was able to pull from his knowledge of the current era and predict that possibilities for improvement were inevitable. With the examples of camera lenses or machines used for arithmetical computations, Bush described these types of technology to be “still in embryo.” To be able to acknowledge that the highest form of technology at the time was something that is still in the beginning phases of potential and create this mindset that more knowledge could be attained is bizarre. However, it was necessary to “make more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge” - which was a large part of Bush’s ideals. It seemed as if Bush was never living within his present and always viewing the world of science as what it could be, especially with his idea of a “memex,” essentially predicting the future of smartphones and computers. 
            I found that his discussion and explanation on how the human mind operates by association can still be prevalently used today. The human mind will take one idea that is lingering and will snap to another that is suggested by an association of thoughts coming from the intricate system in the human brain. Whether it be through memory, subconscious or conscious, the human mind learns from this mental process in order to expand its knowledge. I appreciated the wisdom behind some of his words as well: “Man’s spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems.” With the help of ever-expanding science in society, humans are able to apply this knowledge in order to “elevate” oneself to a better life. As a precis of Bush’s ideas, it seemed to me as if he was telling an audience: Trust in science.
